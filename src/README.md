## OpenAction

### Welcome!

OpenAction is a platform-agnostic, language-agnostic, device-agnostic open WebSocket-based API for providing actions to an OpenAction server for execution on device events such as key presses or dial rotations.

OpenAction is cross-compatible with the Stream Deck SDK, bringing a plethora of excellent plugins to the platform.

This website contains documentation for developers of both plugins and servers.
